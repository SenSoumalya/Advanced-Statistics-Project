## Inferential Statistics Project
## Course: Advanced Statistics

## Project Overview

This project analyzes three separate datasets with the following objectives:

1. **CMSU Student Survey**: Use probability and conditional probability analysis to examine gender distribution, major choices, graduation intentions, and other factors among CMSU students.
2. **Shingle Moisture Analysis**: Conduct hypothesis testing on moisture content in two types of asphalt shingles to ensure product quality.
3. **Salary Data Study**: Use ANOVA to understand salary variations by education level and occupation type and test for interaction effects.

## Data Files

The project uses the following datasets:

- **A+%26+B+shingles.csv**: Contains moisture content data for two types of shingles (A and B).
- **SalaryData.csv**: Records salary information, educational qualifications, and occupation levels.
- **Survey.csv**: Responses from 62 CMSU undergraduate students to a 14-question survey.

## Problem Descriptions and Objectives

### Problem 1: CMSU Student Survey
- **Objective**: Calculate probabilities for various student characteristics, such as:
  - Gender distribution and major choices among male and female students.
  - Graduation intentions, GPA distribution, and employment status.
- **Key Questions**: 
  - What is the probability that a CMSU student is male or female?
  - What is the conditional probability of specific majors among male and female students?
  - What are the probabilities associated with GPA, graduation intentions, and computer ownership?

### Problem 2: Shingle Moisture Content Analysis
- **Objective**: Determine if the moisture content in shingles A and B meets quality standards.
- **Key Questions**: 
  - Is the average moisture content below the permissible limit (0.35 pounds/100 sq ft)?
  - Are the mean moisture levels in shingles A and B equal?

### Problem 3: Salary Data Study
- **Objective**: Assess the effect of educational qualification and occupation on salary using statistical tests.
- **Key Questions**:
  - Is there a significant difference in salary based on education levels?
  - Is there a difference in salary based on occupation?
  - Does an interaction exist between education and occupation affecting salary?

## Analytical Methods

The project employs several statistical methods:

- **Probability & Conditional Probability**: To explore gender, major choices, and other student characteristics.
- **Hypothesis Testing (t-tests)**: For comparing mean moisture content in shingles A and B.
- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: To analyze salary differences by education and occupation levels, and to assess any interaction effects.

## Key Findings

### Problem 1: CMSU Student Survey
- **Gender Distribution**: Calculated probabilities for selecting a male or female student.
- **Major Preferences**: Analyzed conditional probabilities for majors among male and female students.
- **Other Insights**: Insights on graduation intentions, GPA, and employment status among students.

### Problem 2: Shingle Moisture Content Analysis
- **Moisture Content**: Confirmed if shingles A and B met the moisture standards using hypothesis testing.
- **Comparison**: Tested for equal means between shingles A and B to ensure quality consistency.

### Problem 3: Salary Data Study
- **Salary by Education Level**: Found significant differences in salary based on education.
- **Salary by Occupation**: Observed variation in salaries across occupation types.
- **Interaction Effect**: Discovered an interaction between education and occupation affecting salary outcomes, highlighting how education level impacts salary differently across occupations.
